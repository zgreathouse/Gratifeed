# Gratifeed

[Gratifeed](https://serene-refuge-90433.herokuapp.com/) is an app which allows businesses to create surveys, send them out to a list of
recipients, and get the survey results back. This app features Google Oauth, in-app billing
using the Stripe API, a Mailer to send out emails using the SendGrid API. This app was
created using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React-Redux, and Node.js).

Note: I intend to add further styling to this application.

App was created with the help of the following tutorial made by Stephen Grider:
